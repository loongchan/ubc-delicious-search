# _Project_

This wordpress plugin enables users to integrate their delicious links into the wordpress website, with filtering and searching.

_Notes:_
- to use this plugin effectively, you'll need to be very organized and determine ahead of time what tags you are going to use for each filter.
- e.g. if you want to filter by "type" and "color" where: 
  * type => { 'video', 'pdf', 'doc', 'website', 'etc' } 
  * color => { 'red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue', 'indigo', 'violet' }
  * Then for every link you mark with delicious, you should tag it with one type and one color
